      <h1>A little bit About Me</h1>
      <p>
          My name is Nebiyat. I am 20 years old. I am a biolgy/Biotechnology student at BHCC. I love Biology because it challenges me and everyday I get to knew discoveries. I always want to learn about living things and how our body functions. Later on in life I got facinated with the work software enginners and computer scientist do. I like how they develop websites, games, apps, etc. I wanted to be part of this to make websites and learn how to code. I also realized how coding and knowing how to code helps and makes every person's life easier. I also see how computer sceinets and software enginners and others in the computer field contributes to the tech, bussiness, and STEM world.       </p>
